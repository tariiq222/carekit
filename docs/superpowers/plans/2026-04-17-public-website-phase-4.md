# Public Website — Phase 4 (Advanced: Support Groups + ZATCA QR + Refunds + SEO) Implementation Plan

> **⚠️ Plan status:** Most speculative of the four plans — written before Phases 1.5, 2, 3 land. Scope is large; expect to split Phase 4 into 4.b (ZATCA + Refunds) and 4.c (SEO) based on business priority when the time comes.
>
> **🛑 Track A (Subscriptions) REMOVED from scope (2026-04-19).** CareKit is strictly a booking platform — appointment booking + recurring bookings + future session packages (service bundles). Subscription plans were never the product. The code that landed via Phase 4 Track A was removed in `chore/remove-subscription-feature` (PR #13). Tasks A1–A5, Q1, and any §5/§6 references below should be treated as historical context, not work items. When a "packages" requirement arrives, model it as a service-level bundle attached to `Service`, not as a resurrected Subscription system.

**Goal:** Ship the advanced capabilities that turn the public website from a booking tool into a full client-facing compliance + commerce surface: support-group bookings, ZATCA QR on invoices, refund flow, and SEO infrastructure (Schema.org, sitemap, OG images, JSON-LD).

**Architecture:** Each feature is an existing-module extension:
- **Support groups** → existing `group-sessions/` module + public listing/booking
- **ZATCA QR** → existing `zatca/` module + rendering on client-facing invoice view
- **Refunds** → existing `payments/` module + Moyasar refund API + client-facing status
- **SEO** → frontend-only, no backend changes

**Reference Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-public-website-integration-design.md`](../specs/2026-04-17-public-website-integration-design.md) §6 Phase 4.

**Branch:** `feat/website-phase-4` from `main` after Phase 3 merges. Given size, consider splitting into two sub-branches: `feat/website-phase-4b-zatca-refunds`, `-4c-seo`.

## ~~Track A — Subscriptions~~

**REMOVED from scope 2026-04-19.** See PR #13 (`chore/remove-subscription-feature`). CareKit is a booking platform — appointment booking + recurring bookings + future session packages (service bundles). Subscription plans were never the product. Tasks A1–A5 deleted from this plan. When a "packages" requirement arrives, model it as a service-level bundle attached to `Service`, not as a resurrected Subscription system.

## Track B — Support Groups (4 tasks)

### Task B1: Verify existing group-sessions module + public extension

- [ ] **B1.1** Read `apps/backend/src/modules/group-sessions/` (or wherever groups live).

### Task E3: OG images (per therapist + specialty)

- [ ] **E3.1** `apps/website/app/therapists/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` (Next.js convention) — generates OG image dynamically from branding + therapist data.

## QA gate Phase 4 + Kiwi sync

**Cases (one per track):**

- [ ] **Q2** Support group: book a session → appears in account → cancel → refund request PENDING.
- [ ] **Q3** Support group: book when full → placed on waitlist → admin promotes → booking confirmed.
- [ ] **Q4** ZATCA: visit `/account/bookings/[id]/invoice` → QR visible → download PDF → QR scannable.
- [ ] **Q5** Refund: cancel within window → auto-approved → Moyasar refund executes → status REFUNDED.
- [ ] **Q6** Refund: cancel outside window → PENDING_REVIEW → admin approves → executes.
- [ ] **Q7** SEO: view page source on home → JSON-LD present → `/sitemap.xml` lists public therapists.
- [ ] **Q8** OG image: share therapist URL on WhatsApp → preview shows custom OG image.
- [ ] **Q9** Branding invariance still holds end-to-end.
- [ ] **Q10** Kiwi sync + commit report.

## Ship criteria (from spec §6 Phase 4)

- ✅ Support groups bookable publicly with capacity + waitlist.
- ✅ ZATCA QR renders on client invoice views.
- ✅ Refund flow end-to-end.
- ✅ SEO: Schema.org, sitemap, OG images, Core Web Vitals pass.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Group waitlist race (two users grab last spot) | DB transaction + row-level lock on `GroupSession.enrolledCount` |
| ZATCA QR renders wrong data after invoice edit | Regenerate QR on every invoice state transition; snapshot test on QR payload |
| Moyasar refund partial / failure | Webhook-driven; never mark refunded until webhook confirms |
| SEO regressions (page becomes client-rendered by accident) | CI Lighthouse check on PR; fail if CWV regresses |

---

## What's NOT in Phase 4

- Analytics integration (GA4, Meta Pixel, etc.) — future tracked separately with privacy/consent layer.
- Multi-currency (all SAR per current scope).
- Loyalty / referral programs.
- Native mobile app features parity — separate track.

---

## Post-Phase 4 — open questions for follow-up planning

- Do we consolidate the remaining tracks into one Phase 4 PR, or ship as 2 PRs (B+C+D, E)? Recommendation: **2 PRs** — each is a shippable increment, reviewers can focus.
- Do we add a `v1.0` Git tag on main after Phase 4 merges? Recommendation: **yes** — first production-ready milestone.
- Does the product need a public changelog at this point? Probably yes — add a minimal `CHANGELOG.md` during Phase 4.c SEO track.
