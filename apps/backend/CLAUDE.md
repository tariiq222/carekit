# CareKit Backend — Conventions

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working inside `apps/backend`. Read the root [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) first for stack-wide rules (multi-tenant SaaS — `Organization` = tenant, RLS + `TENANT_ENFORCEMENT=strict`, immutable migrations, golden rules).

## Architecture: Domain Clusters + Vertical Slices

The backend is a **Modular Monolith** organized as **domain clusters**, each containing **vertical-slice features**. Controllers are **separated from domain code** and live under `src/api/` by audience.

```

```

### Domain clusters (authoritative — not the old "one module per domain")

| Cluster | Slices inside |
|---|---|
| `identity/` | login, logout, refresh-token, get-current-user, client-auth, otp, list-memberships, switch-organization, users, roles, casl |
| `people/` | clients, employees, specialties |
| `bookings/` | create-/cancel-/confirm-/check-in-/reschedule-/complete-/no-show-/expire-booking, check-availability, create-recurring-booking, waitlist, walk-in, create-zoom-meeting, retry-zoom-meeting |
| `finance/` | payments, moyasar-api, moyasar-webhook, refunds, coupons, zatca-config, zatca-submit, bank-transfer-upload |
| `comms/` | notifications, fcm-tokens, email-templates, send-email, send-sms, send-push, org-sms-config, sms-dlr, contact-messages, chat |
| `ai/` | chatbot RAG (streaming), knowledge-base, pgvector embeddings, semantic-search |
| `media/` | uploads, MinIO presigned URLs |
| `ops/` | health-check, cron-tasks (BullMQ), generate-report, log-activity |
| `content/` | site-settings |
| `org-config/` | branches, categories, departments, business-hours |
| `org-experience/` | branding, intake-forms, ratings, services, org-settings |
| `integrations/` | zoom (encrypted creds get/upsert/test), public branding |
| `platform/` | admin (super-admin), billing, verticals, feature-flags, problem-reports |
| `dashboard/` | get-dashboard-stats |

### Vertical slice anatomy

Each use case is a self-contained folder:

```
modules/bookings/create-booking/
├── create-booking.dto.ts          ← class-validator input shape
├── create-booking.handler.ts      ← @Injectable class with execute(command)
└── create-booking.handler.spec.ts ← colocated unit tests
```

- **Handler, not Service.** The pattern is `XxxHandler` with a single `execute()` method — one slice, one use case.
- **Command type** extends the DTO with decoded values (e.g., `scheduledAt: Date`) and caller identity (`userId`) where needed. Controllers convert DTO → Command.
- **Cross-slice calls:** handlers may inject other handlers directly (`GetBookingSettingsHandler`, `PriceResolverService`). Cross-**cluster** calls go through published handlers/services from that cluster's module exports.
- **Events live in `<cluster>/events/`** as typed event classes extending `BaseEvent` (see [src/common/events/base-event.ts](src/common/events/base-event.ts)). Handlers emit; cross-cluster reaction handlers (e.g., [payment-completed-handler](src/modules/bookings/payment-completed-handler/)) subscribe.
- **Shared helpers** inside a cluster sit at the cluster root (e.g., [booking-lifecycle.helper.ts](src/modules/bookings/booking-lifecycle.helper.ts)).
- **No generic `*.repository.ts`** — handlers use `PrismaService` directly from [infrastructure/database](src/infrastructure/database/).

### Controllers live in `src/api/`, not inside modules

Controllers are grouped **by audience** (`dashboard/`, `mobile/client/`, `mobile/employee/`, `public/`), one file per cluster (`bookings.controller.ts`, `finance.controller.ts`). They:

1. Apply guards (`JwtGuard`, `CaslGuard`) and extract `@UserId()` where needed.
2. Inject handlers from `src/modules/...` and call `handler.execute({ ...dto })`.
3. Do **no business logic** — if you're writing an `if` for domain rules in a controller, it belongs in a handler.

When adding an endpoint: add or extend the slice in `src/modules/<cluster>/<use-case>/`, then wire it in the matching `src/api/<audience>/<cluster>.controller.ts`.

### Infrastructure vs modules

`src/infrastructure/` holds technology adapters (Prisma, BullMQ queues, Redis cache, SMTP/mail, MinIO storage, embeddings). Domain modules depend on infrastructure, never the reverse. Don't put tech concerns (queue definitions, mail transports) inside a cluster.

### Prisma schema is split per cluster

[prisma/schema/](prisma/schema/) has one `.prisma` file per cluster (`bookings.prisma`, `finance.prisma`, etc.) plus `main.prisma` for generator/datasource. Keep model ownership aligned with cluster boundaries.

## Adding work — decision tree

1. **New endpoint on existing use case?** Edit the handler + wire the controller method.
2. **New use case in existing cluster?** Create `modules/<cluster>/<verb-noun>/` with dto + handler + spec, register in `<cluster>.module.ts`, expose through the audience controller.
3. **New domain?** Decide if it fits an existing cluster. Prefer extending a cluster over creating a new one. A new cluster needs: folder under `modules/`, its own `*.module.ts`, a `prisma/schema/<cluster>.prisma` if it owns tables, and at least one controller under `src/api/<audience>/`.
4. **Cross-cluster reaction?** Emit an event from the source cluster; add a handler folder in the consuming cluster (e.g., `payment-completed-handler/`).

```

## Comms cluster — SMS (SaaS-02g-sms)

- **SMS is per-tenant.** Each Organization picks Unifonic or Taqnyat via `/settings/sms` and provides their own credentials. Platform billing does NOT meter SMS — tenants pay their chosen provider directly.
- Dispatch always goes through `SmsProviderFactory.forCurrentTenant(orgId)` — never construct an adapter manually from a handler.
- Credentials are AES-256-GCM encrypted with `SMS_PROVIDER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `organizationId` as AAD — a DB dump alone cannot decrypt under a different tenant context.
- DLR webhooks (`POST /api/v1/public/sms/webhooks/:provider/:organizationId`) follow the 02e three-stage flow: system-context config lookup → signature verify → `cls.run` mutation.
- The `GetOrgSmsConfigHandler` NEVER returns `credentialsCiphertext` or `webhookSecret` — the dashboard form is write-only.

## AI cluster (`src/modules/ai/`)

- **ChatAdapter uses OpenRouter** (OpenAI-compatible), not Anthropic SDK directly. Models are configured via `OPENROUTER_CHAT_MODEL` (default: `anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku`).
- **Prompt structure in `chat-completion.handler.ts`:** system + KB context first, user message last — this is the correct ordering for any cache-friendly model. Do not rearrange.
- **To enable Anthropic native prompt caching** (cache_control breakpoints, ~10× cheaper reads): requires switching ChatAdapter from OpenRouter to `@anthropic-ai/sdk` directly. This is an intentional future decision, not an oversight.
- **Semantic search** (`semantic-search.handler.ts`) uses `pgvector` via `PrismaService.$queryRaw`. Always pass `topK` to limit chunks; default is 5.

## Verticals + Terminology (SaaS-03)

- **Verticals** (`modules/platform/verticals/`) define the activity type a tenant operates under (clinic, salon, gym, etc.) — seeded via 11 verticals × 4 family templates.
- **Terminology packs** rewrite domain nouns per vertical (e.g., `client` → `patient` / `member`). Backend exposes the active pack via `GetTerminologyHandler`; UIs consume through the shared `useTerminology` hook.
- The platform-internal name stays English (`Vertical`); user-facing Arabic is "القطاع".

## Billing / Subscriptions (SaaS-04)

- **Platform billing** lives at `modules/platform/billing/` — plans, subscriptions, invoices, usage metering, dunning. Two Moyasar accounts are in play: the **platform** account collects tenant subscription fees; each tenant's own Moyasar handles their booking-payment revenue.
- Hybrid model: flat plan fee + usage overage. SMS is **not** metered by the platform (per-tenant providers — see SaaS-02g-sms).
- Super-admin oversight (waive, grant, change-plan, refund) lives under `modules/platform/admin/` and is exposed only to the `apps/admin` control plane (separate Next.js app on its own port).

## Integrations cluster (`modules/integrations/`)

- **Zoom** (`integrations/zoom/`) owns the encrypted-credentials lifecycle: get/upsert/test of `accountId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret` per tenant. Credentials are AES-256-GCM encrypted with `organizationId` as AAD — the `Get*` handler never returns ciphertext.
- The bookings cluster (`bookings/create-zoom-meeting/`, `bookings/retry-zoom-meeting/`) **consumes** integrations via `ZoomMeetingService`. Never reach into Zoom credentials from a booking handler — go through the integrations slice.
- Public branding read endpoints also live here (used by unauthenticated mobile/website surfaces).

## Conventions that catch new contributors

- **Multi-tenancy (default).** The backend runs multi-tenant by default. As of SaaS-02h, `TENANT_ENFORCEMENT=strict` is the platform default — any scoped-model query without CLS tenant context throws `UnauthorizedTenantAccessError`. Every cluster (02a–02g) is scoped; `SCOPED_MODELS` in `prisma.service.ts` lists the 52 tenant-scoped entities. `permissive` and `off` remain only for local dev + migration bootstrap. See `test/e2e/security/` for the contract (direct-id probe, IDOR, FK injection, `$queryRaw` backstop, webhook forgery, strict-mode enforcement).
- **One handler = one public method (`execute`).** Don't add `executeVariant()`; create a new slice.
- **Tests colocated as `*.handler.spec.ts`** next to the handler, not in a parallel `test/` tree.
- **Payments, ZATCA, auth, and migrations are owner-only** (see root CLAUDE.md "Security Sensitivity Tiers").
- **Migrations are immutable** — never edit or squash existing ones; add a new migration instead.

## Client Auth (Phase 3 — separate token namespace)

Client auth (website users) is **fully isolated** from admin JWT auth:

| | Admin/Dashboard JWT | Client JWT |
|---|---|---|
| Namespace claim | `role`, `permissions` | `client` namespace via `aud` or custom claim |
| Secret | `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | `JWT_CLIENT_ACCESS_SECRET` |
| Guard | `JwtGuard` + `CaslGuard` | `ClientSessionGuard` |
| Token delivery | `Authorization: Bearer` | `httpOnly cookie` (XSS-safe) |
| Stored in | Memory/API calls | Browser cookie jar |

**Password policy:** minimum 8 chars, at least 1 uppercase letter, at least 1 digit.

**Login modes:**
- **Password login** — primary path. Client submits phone + password → `POST /api/v1/public/auth/login`.
- **OTP-only login** — escape hatch for clients who forgot password. Uses existing `CLIENT_LOGIN` purpose via `POST /api/v1/public/otp/request` + `verify`. No password required.

## API Documentation (Standard level)

Every HTTP endpoint in `src/api/**` MUST have:

- `@ApiTags('<Audience> / <Cluster>')` on the controller — tag list is closed, see [spec](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-api-documentation-design.md#audience--cluster-tag-map).
- `@ApiOperation({ summary })` — English, imperative ("Create a booking").
- `@ApiStandardResponses()` from `src/common/swagger` plus endpoint-specific success/404 responses.
- `@ApiParam`/`@ApiQuery` on every route/query parameter.

Every DTO used as `@Body` or `@Query`:
- `@ApiProperty({ description, example })` on required fields.
- `@ApiPropertyOptional({ description, example })` on optional fields.

Regenerate the OpenAPI snapshot after any change:

    npm run openapi:build-and-snapshot

Commit `apps/backend/openapi.json` alongside the endpoint change — CI fails if the snapshot drifts from source.
