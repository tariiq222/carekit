# CareKit Mobile — Expo React Native

## Tech

React Native 0.83, Expo SDK 55, Expo Router (file-based), Redux Toolkit + redux-persist (auth only), TanStack Query v5 (all server data), Axios, i18next (AR/EN), React Hook Form + Zod, Expo Notifications (FCM), Zoom Meeting SDK (via JoinVideoCallButton).

## Conventions

- **Routing**: Expo Router file-based — `_layout.tsx` defines navigators; client and employee groups are strictly separated.
- **State**:
  - **Redux Toolkit is for `auth` only** (token + refreshToken + user, persisted via `redux-persist` to Expo Secure Store). No new slices without explicit discussion.
  - **All server data → TanStack Query v5** in `hooks/queries/` (one hook per resource, exported through `hooks/queries/index.ts`).
  - Transient UI state (modals, form drafts, typing indicators) → component-level `useState`/`useReducer`.
- **API**: Axios services in `services/` — one file per domain; `services/client/` and `services/employee/` hold role-specific endpoints.
- **i18n**: `i18next` + `react-i18next` — translation files in `i18n/`; keys mirror dashboard/backend tokens.
- **Theme**: Branding tokens consumed from backend `PublicBranding` (per-tenant) via the theme slice; never hardcode brand colors.
- **Components**: Reusable in `components/`, feature-specific stay in `app/`.

## Service Files (`services/`)

Top-level: `api.ts` (base Axios + interceptors), `auth.ts`, `branches.ts`, `chatbot.ts`, `clients.ts`, `employees.ts`, `notifications.ts`, `organization.ts`, `payments.ts`, `push.ts`, `query-client.ts`, `tenant.ts`.

Subdirectories: `services/client/` (client-only endpoints), `services/employee/` (employee-only endpoints).

## Query Hooks (`hooks/queries/`)

`useBooking`, `useBookingMutations`, `useBranding`, `useChat`, `useClientBookings`, `useEmployeeClients`, `useEmployeeDayBookings`, `useNotifications`, `usePortal`, `useSlots`, `useTherapist`, `useTherapists`, `useUpcomingBookings` — re-exported via `hooks/queries/index.ts`.

## Tenant Strategy — One App per Tenant

`apps/mobile/` is **single-tenant by design**. The `dashboard` and `admin` apps are multi-tenant; mobile is not. Every published build is locked to exactly one organization.

- **Current build:** `سواء للإرشاد الأسري` (Sawa) — bundle `sa.sawa.app`, vertical `family-consulting`. See `app.config.ts`.
- **Tenant lock mechanism:** `X-Org-Id` header is sent on every request via the Axios interceptor in `services/api.ts`; the org id comes from a hard-coded `TENANT_ID` constant in `constants/config.ts`. Backend `TenantResolverMiddleware` honors this header on public routes only — JWT still wins on authenticated routes (see plan `2026-04-25-mobile-tenant-lock-sawa`).
- **No runtime tenant switching.** Do not add a tenant switcher, multi-org membership UI, or dynamic vertical hot-swap to mobile. `services/tenant.ts` exists for the header plumbing only.
- **Branding & terminology** are still fetched at runtime via `PublicBranding` + `useTerminology()` — but for the locked tenant only. Switching tenant is not a user-facing operation.

### Adding a new tenant app

A second tenant means a **new build**, not a runtime mode:

1. Fork `apps/mobile/` (or branch + variant config).
2. Replace `app.config.ts` (`name`, `slug`, `scheme`, `bundleIdentifier`, `package`, `icon`).
3. Drop new assets under `assets/<slug>/`.
4. Update `TENANT_ID` in `constants/config.ts`.
5. Publish under the new bundle ID on App Store / Play Store.

Backend, dashboard, and admin do not change.

## Branding (Per-Tenant Theme)

- `useBranding` query fetches `PublicBranding` for the active org.
- Theme slice (Redux) consumes the result and exposes tokens to RN components.
- All colors, logo, and typography flow from this — no hardcoded brand values anywhere.

## Terminology

- `hooks/useTerminology.ts` mirrors the dashboard's hook.
- Resolves vertical-aware labels (e.g. "Patient" vs "Client" vs "Beneficiary") from the active org's vertical/terminology pack.
- Use `t()` for static i18n, `useTerminology()` for vertical-sensitive nouns.

## Push Notifications (FCM)

- `services/push.ts` registers the Expo push token with the backend, handles permission prompts, and routes incoming notifications.
- Deep-links: notification payloads carry a route — tapping navigates into the relevant screen (appointment, chat, invoice).
- Mark-read flow + unread-count badge driven by `useNotifications`.
- Tests in `services/__tests__/push.test.ts`.

## Video Calls (Zoom)

- `JoinVideoCallButton` component encapsulates eligibility logic.
- Join window: `[appointment.start - 15min, appointment.end]` — button is disabled outside that window.
- Two screens: `app/(client)/video-call.tsx` (attendee) and `app/(employee)/video-call.tsx` (host).
- Backend issues short-lived Zoom JWT/SDK signatures; never store Zoom secrets on device.

## Key Rules

- No `any` in TypeScript
- No hardcoded strings — use i18n keys (and `useTerminology` for vertical-sensitive nouns)
- No hardcoded colors — branding tokens from backend
- 350-line max per file
- Client and Employee routes must stay strictly separated
- Expo Secure Store for sensitive data (tokens), AsyncStorage for non-sensitive preferences
- Tenant context is mandatory on every authenticated request

## Development

```bash
npm run dev           # Expo start (Metro bundler)
npm run ios           # iOS simulator
npm run android       # Android emulator
npm run test          # Jest + jest-expo
```
